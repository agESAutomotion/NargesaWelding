1. continuity mode PWM 50hz 30%, laser power 3KW, peak power 3KW, rising, power laser starting 30%,  laser on progressive time 100ms
2. continuity mode PWM 50hz 30%, laser power 3KW, peak power 3KW, falling, laser power off 20%, laser off progressive time 500ms
3. same but with cursors.

4. continuity mode PWM 50hz 30%, laser power 3KW, peak power 2KW, falling, laser power off 20%, laser off progressive time 500ms
5. continuity mode PWM 50hz 30%, laser power 3KW, peak power 2KW, rising, power laser starting 30%,  laser on progressive time 100ms

******spot mode --> Interval, PWM 50hz 30%, laser power 3KW, peak power 2KW, rising, power laser starting 30%,  
	laser on progressive time 100ms
	laser off progressive time 500ms
	spot welding duration = 500 ms
	spot welding interval = 900 ms

6. graph measuring the spot welding duration
7. graph measuring the spot welding interval

*****spot mode --> Fish scale, PWM 50hz 30%, laser power 3KW, peak power 2KW, rising, power laser starting 30%, 
	laser on progressive time 100ms
	laser off progressive time 500ms
	spot welding duration = 500 ms
	spot welding interval = 900 ms

8. graph measuring the first pulse composed of the laser progressive time + spot welding time
9. graph measuring the ON cycle of the next pulse
10. graph measuring the OFF cycle of the next pulse
11. ignore
